                  <p>Kate Moss is thriving in her forties. First, she started her own modelling agency, then she landed a multi-million-dollar deal with Diet Coke, and now there’s the announcement of her very own beauty and wellness brand, Cosmoss.
                  </p>
                  <p>The news, which officially dropped on Tuesday, came via a video that captured the 48-year-old British supermodel taking a wild swim in the nude. ‘Follow me to Cosmoss’, says the voice of Moss over the film, glancing back to camera before sinking into the natural waters of a countryside pond.</p>
                  <p>So far, so cryptic, but it didn’t stop Moss’s bevvy of close celebrity friends from commenting on the post: ‘If it makes your bum look that good, I’m getting some. ❤️’. Said Bella Freud. ‘This is exciting!’ said fellow model, Karen Elson.</p>
                  <p>Set to officially launch on 1 September, Moss is continuing to drip-feed hints about what to expect on the company’s official Instagram account. ‘Each product has been meticulously crafted with wellbeing in mind; each ritual opens a door to balance, restoration, and love.’ And although the products remain undisclosed, rumours point to fragrances, speciality teas, and gold nectar CBD-infused face oils.</p>
                  <p>What we do know is that the range will most likely be positioned as a UK rival to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop or Kim Kardashian’s Poosh. But unlike those aforementioned wellness czars, Moss’s pedigree is altogether more complex. As the pin-up girl of 1990s grunge, Moss – who famously said: ‘Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels’ – is the ultimate former party girl, meaning she’s not the typical face of a squeaky-clean wellness brand.</p>
                  <p>That being said, in the 13 years since Moss uttered those infamous words, the Croydon-born fashion icon has begun dipping her toes into the pursuit of self-betterment. She is now sober. She also practices yoga with celebrity teacher, Nadia Narain, and according to The Guardian, has been eating salads and juicing since 2017.</p>
                  <p>With Cosmoss, Moss is cleverly hoping to bottle her personal – and wider cultural – shift from hedonist to holistic. The brand notes that the line is inspired by ‘Kate’s extraordinary life experiences, her own wellness journey, and her personal transformation’.</p>
                  <p>Cosmoss will be available to purchase from 1 September via the website here.</p>
